Stonehaven Village

Nestled high in the Frostpeak Mountains, Stonehaven is a small mining community of about 200 souls. The village exists primarily to extract iron ore and precious gems from the nearby Deepdelve Mine.

The villagers are hardy folk, used to harsh winters and the constant threat of mountain predators. Most families have lived here for generations, with the Ironfoot clan serving as unofficial leaders since the village's founding.

Recent troubles include strange noises from the deeper mine shafts and several miners reporting glimpses of glowing eyes in the darkness. Elder Thorek Ironfoot has forbidden access to the lower levels until the source can be determined.

The village inn, "The Pickaxe and Pint," serves as the social center where miners gather after long shifts to share news, complaints, and the occasional tall tale.
